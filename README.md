1.Define the approach for automation testing of this functionality 
GOAL of automaton- Create new automation of API testing which will perform CRUD operations for employee records
Identify common things like base URL
Identify status sent by APIs
Identify test data to be sent 
Verify output of execution
Generate report of execution
There are two different ways to develop this automation.
a)Rest-assured with Page object model framework
b)Rest-assured with Cucumber framework
Anticipated challenges:
There are many challenges to automate any API in general. Below are some of them.
Setting up infrastructure
Maintaining test data formatting to handle request and response of API
Testing different parameter combinations
Executing APIs for multi-threaded application in specific sequence
Validating parameters

2.Strategy:
First, it is very reasonable to use a framework/library which provides us testing an API easily in a short period of time and I chose the Rest-assured library.

3.What is your approach to create input test data set?
